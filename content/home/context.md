Massive data production is a critical aspect of experimental sciences. Many areas have experienced the exponential growth of data availability in the past decade. It has not been different for geoscience. Examples of geoscientific data include any physical observable related to the energy industry, mining, monitoring of hazardous areas (e.g. effects of salt mining in populated areas), among many others. Nowadays, with the relative facility and lowering the cost to acquire data -- even in continuous mode -- the data processing to exploit their value, is a challenge: it requires expertise in data maintenance and processing, data analysis, and in the design of experiments of target domains for which data will provide insight and knowledge. 

Traditional analysis in the area using these computing and data services revolves around the creation of physics-based models. These are developed and executed by geoscience professionals with a deep understanding of geology, geophysics, engineering, reservoir dynamics, production technology and economics, among other things. They are supported by data managers who ensure the availability of high-quality data that powers the decision-making process. In contexts where there is a high density of data, significant actions are now being invested in advanced analytical techniques such as machine learning, to augment decisions traditionally made exclusively by geoscientists and engineers. 

Many scientists and companies believe that they can generate fresh insight, reduce decision cycle times and steal a march on their competition by automating the search for patterns and relationships in their data. Therefore, geophysics and data science including algorithms, mathematical models and computing must converge for developing experiments for obtaining insight and foresight about the observations contained in data collections. Experiments represent best practices for addressing problems and questions on geophysics that must be treated as data and knowledge to be shared and reused by scientists and practitioners. 

##### OBJECTIVE

The ADAGEO Summit and Thematic School aims at promoting scientific discussion and practical actions and projects that can address geosciences problems through data science solutions. Thereby, the actions and interaction in this event will build a scientific and particcioiners transdisciplinary community the will develop a novel way of doing geosciences.
