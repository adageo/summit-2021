### Challenges:

* [Challenge 1: Estimating the approximate earthquake epicentres](#ch1)
* [Challenge 2: Estimation of stacking velocity using CDP semblance](#ch2)
* [Challenge 3: Filtering data from sensors](#ch3)

### Objective

Have a hands on experience on designing and implementing data science experiments for addressing geophysics problems.  

### General Rules

1. Groups of 4 participants, if possible, gender/regional/discipline-balanced.
1. Notebooks should be public and accessible online (Kaggle, Colab, Github).
1. Groups can use libraries, methods and any other material required respecting the intellectual property of authors.
1. Short demo - video pitch specifying image privacy of authors.

### Schedule

- The school has organised lectures (29/11 - 1/12) that will introduce principles, methods, models and geophysics problems for addressing data science experiments.
- Daily online working sessions (3H 29/11 - 1/12) will be devoted for groups to work and then they can work separately until the 02/12.
- Groups will choose a challenge and will work with a couch assigned the 29/11 during a working session who will provide feedback and hints to implement solutions.
- Demo fest: 03/12 groups will present their results in a 5 minutes madness session.
- Winners will be awarded during the closing session 03/12.

### To Handin

1. Notebook with the full profiling, study and preparation of your data. Use plots whenever possible.
2. If data is prepared or engineered, a link to the repository of the prepared dataset
3. Notebook with the solution with the explanation of the principle, of the phases of the study with partial     results interpretation, results and fundamental the adopted assessment method. Use plots whenever possible.
