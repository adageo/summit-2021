For instance, the well-known series of Landsat missions (among the most prominent, 1 in 1972, 5 in 1984, 7 in 1999, 8 in 2013 and 9 in 2021); MODIS (Terra in 1999 and Aqua in 2002); Aster (1999); Quickbird (2001); and the Copernicus program with its 5 Sentinels missions (in orbit from 2015). Furthermore, images captured under demand by drones also increase this list. Therefore, in the last two decades, not only the available satellites for monitoring the earth&rsquo;s physical, climate and environmental variables have increased, but also the periodicity, amount and details of such images have also augmented and improved. In this context, the geosciences have not been excluded from these transformations. New challenges and opportunities have emerged for big, multi-dimensional and multi-temporal data storage and analysis. This talk presents &ldquo;The what, where and when of space-time cubes&rdquo; and focuses on describing the spatial and temporal dimensions of the data structure known as space-time cubes. First, its dimensions will be conceptualized using the rubik&rsquo;s cube metaphor; second, applications of satellite images' time series for climate and environmental variables will be shown; finally, software tools implementing spatio-temporal cubes will be presented.</p><h3 id=bio>Bio</h3><p><strong>Daniela Ballari</strong> is land surveyor by National University of Córdoba in Argentina (2014), and obtained her Ph.D by Wageningen University in the Netherlands (2012).

The Brazilian Seismographic Network is a continental-wide network with more than 90 stations that are used to monitor Brazilian seismicity. While the network is a revolution in terms of available data most of the events in Brazil continue to be declared by visually analyzing day-plots records. We lack well-defined parameters and even, adapted procedures to search for events recorded by the network or a subset of it. The traditional process of declaring a new earthquake involves the detection of seismic phases arrival times, mainly P- and S-wave on continuous records, that later must be sorted and finally grouped to nucleate possible events while false detections must be discarded. The most simple and used detection algorithm is the STA/LTA method that returns detection times from continuous records. The nucleation is a delicate process that normally works well on the global scale, or just when detection times of different events and phases are not mixed in time. Since earthquake position and origin time are not known, it is impossible to compute theoretical travel times at this stage. The information available is restricted to station coordinates and detection times. In some cases, instead of using detection time, the full detection waveform can be used. In that case, events must be nucleated directly from waveforms instead of considering the individual detection times.</p><h3 id=bio>Bio</h3><p><strong>Marcelo Bianchi</strong> is currently a professor at the Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas from Universidade de São Paulo, where he develops research in the area of seismology, basically with the development of methods and procedures for detecting seismic events and studies of crust and mantle structure.

He has experience with different programming languages, developing from small processing scripts to intermediate size, complex object-oriented programs to manage and process seismological data.</p></div></div></div></section><section id=Lebbah class="home-section wg-blank"><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-lg-4 section-heading"><h1>Scalable Machine Learning</h1><p>Mustapha Lebbah</p></div><div class="col-12 col-lg-8"><p>This course will provide students with an introduction to scalable Machine Learning.

However, this progress weighty depends on human experts to perform manual tasks such as hyperparameter optimization, neural architecture search, and dynamic algorithm configuration. As the complexity of these tasks is often beyond non-experts, a demand for off-the-shelf methods that can be used easily and without expert knowledge has emerged. This research area that targets progressive automation of methods is called Automation machine learning. Among those algorithms, deep learning, particularly deep convolutional neural networks have shown very good success and attracted attention from industry people and researchers in computer vision and image processing, neural networks, and machine learning. Our approach relies on evolutionary computation techniques (ES). ES started playing a significant role in automatically determining deep structures, transfer functions, and parameters to tackle image classification tasks, and have great potential to advance the developments of deep structures and algorithms. This talk will provide an extended view of deep learning, overview the state-of-the-art evolutionary deep learning using Genetic Programming (GP) to automatically evolving deep structures.
